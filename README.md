# FinRL-Hybrid

Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading:

- **FinRL** environment for data/indicators/trading env  
- **Soft Actor–Critic (SAC)** via Stable-Baselines3  
- **Kalman pairs** (dynamic hedge ratio) for mean reversion  
- Optional **Recurrent PPO (LSTM)** regime score (sb3-contrib)  
- **Fusion**: SAC & Kalman actions mixed, gated by regime score

## Model Overview — What the Hybrid Approach Brings

This model integrates three complementary layers to make trading more adaptive, interpretable, and robust across changing market conditions.

### 1) Learning + Structure Combined

- Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) learns continuous actions directly from market data, capturing nonlinear dynamics and momentum effects.  
- Kalman pairs trading provides a model-based anchor: a dynamic hedge ratio βₜ between correlated assets and mean-reversion signals from the spread’s z-score.  

Together, they blend deep RL flexibility with a more structural market equilibrium logic.

### 2) Regime Awareness (optional)

A Recurrent PPO–LSTM module can produce a regime score \( rₜ ∈ [-1, 1] \) reflecting current market behavior (trend ↔ mean reversion).  
This score continuously modulates the mix between SAC and Kalman actions:


```math

a\_{\\text{final}}
= w\_{\\text{SAC}}(r\_t)\\, a\_{\\text{SAC}}
+ w\_{\\text{Kalman}}(r\_t)\\, a\_{\\text{Kalman}},\\qquad r\_t \\in \[-1,1]

```



The policy naturally adapts to changes in volatility, directionality, and liquidity.

### 3) Stability and Interpretability

- The model-based (Kalman) pillar limits erratic RL behavior and acts as a safety net.  
- Each component (SAC, Kalman, regime) is traceable, improving analysis and explainability.  
- More controlled exposures → smoother PnL and contained drawdowns.

### 4) Full Evaluation Pipeline

- Periodic PnL during training (callbacks)  
- Per-ticker PnL and cumulative curves  
- Transaction costs and trade markers  
- Portfolio value & benchmark comparison plots  
- Automatic exports under `fig/` (CSV + PNG)

\##  Architecture

```

\[Market Data] → \[FinRL Env + Features] → SAC ┐ ├──> Fusion (regime-gated) → Δshares → Evaluation \& Plots \[Kalman pairs (β\_t)] ───────┘ (optional) RecurrentPPO-LSTM → Regime score r\_t ∈ \[−1,1]

```

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Clone & create env
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 2) Run the hybrid script (defaults from the file)

```bash

python run\_hybrid\_trader.py

```

Outputs are saved under fig/ (CSV + PNG).

## What you get



- Periodic PnL on test env during training (callbacks)

- Per-ticker PnL (CSV + plot)

- Account value \& PnL curves

- Trade markers on a chosen ticker

- Summary CSV (fig/summary\_pnl.csv)



## Main flags



- ```--use-kalman/--no-kalman``` — enable Kalman pairs leg

- ```--use-sac/--no-sac``` — enable SAC agent

- ```--use-ppo-lstm/--no-ppo-lstm``` — compute regime score if sb3-contrib available

-  ```--spread-bps, --fee-bps — costs; --eps-trade``` — min abs(Δshares) to execute



## Repro tips



- Increase ```--sac-steps``` for better convergence on full runs

- Pin your environment with ```pip freeze > requirements.lock.txt```

- Use TensorBoard via SB3 if you add logging (```--tensorboard-log tb\_logs```)
